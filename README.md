CropConnect
CropConnect is a platform dedicated to bridging the gap between farmers and consumers, ensuring that no farmer goes to bed hungry. Our mission is to provide farmers with a direct channel to showcase their crops and set fair prices, while consumers gain access to fresh produce from local farmers.

Features
Farmer Portal: Farmers can log in, add crops with quantity and cost, categorize them by growing seasons, and delete listings when needed.

Consumer Portal: Consumers can log in, view available crops within their area range, and get details about the farmers and crops.

Voice Assistant: We've implemented a voice assistant to facilitate easy navigation for farmers who may not be fluent in English.

Shopping Cart & Checkout: Consumers can easily add desired crops to their cart, proceed to checkout, and make secure payments.

Reviews: Users can submit reviews and feedback to the admin, ensuring continuous improvement.

Tech Stack
CropConnect is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, providing a robust and scalable solution.

How to Use
Farmers: Log in to manage your crops, update prices, and delete listings.
Consumers: Log in to explore available crops, add them to your cart, and complete the purchase.
Feedback
We welcome feedback from both farmers and consumers. Please submit reviews and report any issues to help us enhance CropConnect and fulfill our commitment to supporting local farmers.

No farmer should sleep with hunger! Join us in connecting farmers with consumers for a sustainable and thriving agricultural community.
